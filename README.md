## Data Analyst

## A bit about me...
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a Data Analyst based in Wellington, NZ. 

My passion for data began years ago as a digital marketing operator. One of my notable achievements was creating a marketing campaign for segments of customers grouped by spending habits. I shifted the peak time according to data, which resulted in us exceeding our target by 160% for that event. Although it was a simple project, I understand data's power and its benefits. 
I even used census data to create a dashboard for my family to choose a suitable suburb.

You can find out more about that further down the page...
