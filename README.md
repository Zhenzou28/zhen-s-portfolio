## Data Analyst

## A bit about me...
Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a Data Analyst based in Wellington, NZ. 

My passion for data started when I was digital marketing operator years ago.
One of my achievements to date was creating a marketing campaign for 3 segments of customers grouped by spending habits and shifted the peak time according to data, it makes us exceeded our target by 150% for that event - although a simple project, I understand the power of data the benefits it provides.
I even used census data to make dashboard for my family to pick a suitable suburb.

You can find out more about that further down the page...
